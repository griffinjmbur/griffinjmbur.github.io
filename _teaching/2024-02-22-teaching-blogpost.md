I've taught many courses as a graduate student . I generally get quite good reviews; you can see the public ones here (archived 2024-02-22). 



My lectures on introductory statistics, written for SOC360, "Statistics for Social Scientists I", can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-AlJMRJ_qG1xK8LRss2AWZEv8EqR2MOt?usp=drive_link). I have lectured this course three times as the person actually delivering the content, in 2021fa, 2022fa, and 2023sp (I technically lectured it twice more during the early days of the remote/lockdown epoch, where my role was basically the tutor for a course with pre-taped lectures from Prof. Christin Schwartz + the course admin.) 

I've also lectured SOC357, a course in quantitative and qualitative research methods, a couple of times. Since the quantitative part of the course is quite short, I eschewed a textbook and simply wrote my own (very short) textbook [here](https://griffinjmbur.github.io/soc357su23onlinebook/intro.html). 

I have also lectured a course in computing for social science. I wrote substantial Stata lecture notes for the course, which you can find [here](https://github.com/griffinjmbur/codebackup/tree/main/soc365sp22%20excerpts/final%20lectures%20from%20Canvas). These notes are based on Mitchell's excellent *Data Management Using Stata*, but they include a large number of original examples and my commentary on discrete mathematics. 

In a (slightly) past life, I did teach substantial sociology courses in the two fields that represent my primary interests. I taught all of these courses as a TA; my lecture experience is exclusively in methodological courses, but I generally find teaching substantial sociology completely effortless.

The first is SOC125, "American Society: How It Really Works", based on the textbook of the same name, written by the living legend Joel Rogers and the sadly-dead legend Erik Olin Wright, my first graduate school advisor. My notes written as a teaching assistant are [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1I7Q2qzbWmGnrSvMIytVlHyVnRDmjGAlf). They will primarily be of interest to you if you are teaching a course using this book, but if you are simply trying to teach an ambitious undergraduate sociology course, I suspect that they will also be of use to you. The course is an introduction to conventional-liberal and social-democratic Marxish views of capitalism, with chapters devoted to some interesting special topics (the environment, health care, transportation, taxation, unions, &c.), with the back third of the book discussing theories of capitalist democracy in the Przeworskian mode.
