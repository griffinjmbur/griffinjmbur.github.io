I've taught many courses as a graduate student, lecturing statistical and general-methodological courses (and TAing for several substantial sociological courses in political economy and demography). I generally get quite good reviews; you can see the public ones [here](https://archive.ph/2FfJl) (archived 2024-02-22). Below is some of the large volume of original material I've produced for for those courses.

# Lecture experience

I've principally taught three courses as a lecturer: SOC360, "Statistics for Social Scientists I"; SOC365, "Computing for Social Science"; and, SOC357, "Social Research Methods".

My lecture notes on introductory statistics, written for SOC360, "Statistics for Social Scientists I", can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1zBNVxIcYN1Ejeo25wOwxOOjil8PzxqZx), supplemented by slides [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-AlJMRJ_qG1xK8LRss2AWZEv8EqR2MOt?usp=drive_link) in the last few weeks. I have lectured this course three times as the person actually delivering the content, in 2021fa, 2022fa, and 2023sp (I technically lectured it twice more during the early days of the remote/lockdown epoch, where my role was basically the tutor for a course with pre-taped lectures from Prof. Christine Schwartz + the course admin.) The taped lectures can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DDHitgVMms&list=PLRRWF2nT8_keDjYfr75C2DlwxfB4XDwhU). A key component of this course is a basic data analysis project. My standalone guide to that project, beginning with the installation of Stata, is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DDHitgVMms&list=PLRRWF2nT8_keDjYfr75C2DlwxfB4XDwhU) (links to the relevant code are found in the Youtube description). 

I have also lectured a course in computing for social science, SOC365. I wrote substantial Stata lecture notes for the course, which you can find [here](https://github.com/griffinjmbur/soc365sp22). These notes are based on Mitchell's excellent *Data Management Using Stata*, but they include a large number of original examples and my commentary on discrete mathematics. 

I've also lectured SOC357, a course in quantitative and qualitative research methods, a couple of times. Since the quantitative part of the course is quite short, I eschewed a textbook and simply wrote my own (very short) textbook [here](https://griffinjmbur.github.io/soc357su23onlinebook/intro.html). The taped lectures can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h6SEivzG0Q&list=PLRRWF2nT8_kdnQ9mETxRniiWmDOmE8eNi). 

# Teaching assistant (TA) experience

In a (slightly) past life, I did teach substantial sociology courses in the two fields that represent my primary interests. I taught all of these courses as a TA; my lecture experience is exclusively in methodological courses, but I generally find teaching substantial sociology completely effortless.

The first is SOC125, "American Society: How It Really Works", based on the textbook of the same name, written by the living legend Joel Rogers and the sadly-dead legend Erik Olin Wright, my first graduate school advisor; I taught for both of them, as well as graduate student lecturer. My notes written as a teaching assistant are [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1I7Q2qzbWmGnrSvMIytVlHyVnRDmjGAlf). They will primarily be of interest to you if you are teaching a course using this book, but if you are simply trying to teach an ambitious undergraduate sociology course, I suspect that they will also be of use to you. The course is an introduction to conventional-liberal and social-democratic Marxish views of capitalism, with chapters devoted to some interesting special topics (the environment, health care, transportation, taxation, unions, &c.), with the back third of the book discussing theories of capitalist democracy in the Przeworskian mode. 

The second is SOC170, "Population Problems", a somewhat archaic name for what is basically "introduction to demography". My notes for this class do not make as much sense outside of the context of the course, but I thought that I would mention that I have taught this course a couple of times as the "head TA". These course were taught with Jenna Nobles and Michal Engelman.
